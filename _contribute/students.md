# Student Projects
Students have made invaluable contributions to the platform. If you are
a student, or working with a group of students, we encourage you to
contact us at [questions@sanamobile.org](mailto:questions@sanamobile.org?Subject=Student%Project)
and use the following template for your message:

    Contact:(list names and email addresses)
    University:(Any affiliation. Especially if you are thinking of doing
        the work as part of your courses)
    Background:(Please list experience of anyone working with you)
    Area of interest:(Be as specific as you can)
    Questions:(Anything you want to ask us)

The information above will help us when discussing projects. If you are
uncertain as to what you would like to work or are interested in working
on several items, your background will help us guide you to a project that
is appropriate based on your skills.

You should also start by going through the general [Get Involved](/contribute/index/)
page section for [Developers](/contribute/index/#developers) as well as
the documentation in the [Developer Guide](/developers/index/).
    
## Slack
To help us stay organized and especially answer your questions, we like
to use [Slack](https://slack.com/) as a communication tool so please sign
up if you don't have an account. If we work with you on a project, we
will use it as the primary tool for communications and will follow up 
with additional information on connecting to a Sana 
[Slack](https://slack.com/) team.

## Get Recognition
For all student projects that are selected, we will provide recognition 
of your contribution on the official [Sana website](http://sana.mit.edu).
In addition, you will have a record of your work recorded in your Github
commits. Note: we are rebuilding the site so don't be alarmed if you can't
find the student contributions page. It will be up shotly.

If you are interested in course credit, we do not provide course credit 
through MIT and we can't promise you will be available through your 
university. However, we will be happy to work with you if it is 
available through your university. We have had a number of students work
on Sana related projects as part of their course work and even as 
capstone projects.
