## Installation
The general requirements for running the Sana mobile app.

1. One or more Android based smartphones with Android version 2.1 or 
later.
2. Internet access for smartphone(s) - WiFi or cellular data plan
3. Ubuntu 14.04LTS server with a 1 GHz or faster processor and at 
least 1 GB ram.


### Mobile Client
There are two basic methods for installing the mobile client on an 
Android based phone. Both require the following:

1. Android based device with Android version 2.1 or later</li>
2. Device configured to allow installation of applications from unknown 
sources. This option is available by navigating to __Settings → Applications__

### Recommended Method
This method only requires the mobile device you wish to install the 
application on and an internet connection, either mobile or WiFi.

1. Open a web browser on the mobile device.
2. Enter the url of a copy of the mobile application. For example:

        http://demo.sana.csail.mit.edu/downloads/android/sana-current.apk```

    You should be provided the url by an adminstrator or others who provide 
    support for your deployment if you are not a developer and did not 
    compile the client directly.

    Note: If you have difficulty installing using this method and are 
    certain the url to the application is correct, you may want to consider
    using an alternative browser. The 
    [Dolphin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.mgeek.TunnyBrowser)
    web browser available through the Google Play store is free of charge 
    and known to work well when using this installation method.

2. Connect the mobile device to the PC using a USB cord.
3. Copy the application to your mobile device.
4. Open a file browser on the mobile device and locate the copied file.
