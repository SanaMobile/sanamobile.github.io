title: Client Installation
---

The Sana client application should run on any phone that is running the Android Operating System. Examples include the Google G1, Motorola Droid and Droid Eris, MyTouch 3G, HTC Hero, and the Nexus One. You must update your operating system to Version 1.6 or later to use Sana. If you have a phone with the correct operating system and version and Sana does not work, please post on sana-users@googlegroups.com.

This process takes less than five minutes to complete on each phone.

Enable Non-Market Applications
==============================

Enter the settings menu. Select "Applications." Check the box labeled "Unknown Sources" if it is not already checked.

Download and Install Sana Client
================================

Launch the web browser on your Android phone. From an Android phone, click on the link below for the current release version of the client. The file will be downloaded over WiFi, 3G, or GPRS as available and should appear automatically in the download list. When the download is complete, tap the entry in the list to install the application.

Configure Sana Client
=====================

Enter MDS Information
---------------------

The client should be set to point to the MDS at **demo.sana.csail.mit.edu** by default. This is a public server and is intended for demonstration purposes only. Feel free to test your client with this server, but never send any real patient data to it.

If you are deploying Sana, you must [set up your own server](/Installation "wikilink") and point your clients to it. Do this on the phone by pressing the Menu key and selecting the MDS URL option. Also change the Username and Password for the medical records system to reflect your server setup.

Initialize Database
-------------------

Press the Menu key on your phone and select "Reload DB." Then press the Menu key again and press "Sync." This will populate the list of forms on your client installation.

Begin Using Sana
================

Sana is now ready to use. You may fill out and upload forms through the button labeled "Start New Encounter" on the Sana main screen.
