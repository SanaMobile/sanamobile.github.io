The diagram below presents a slightly abstracted view of the core.models in that the data types are not presented as the <code>django.db.models.fields.Field</code> classes. It is included as such here in that the field labels are consistent with those exposed to the mobile clients and accessible through the <a href="MDS-REST-API">REST API</a>. Additional <code>django.db.model.fields.Field</code>s for the models are included in the Python implementation when deemed necessary.</p>
