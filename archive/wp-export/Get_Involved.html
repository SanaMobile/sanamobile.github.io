<h3>Get involved</h3>
If you are a developer interested in making code contributions, the easiest way to do so is to obtain a GIthub account, fork the source code of the specific component you would like to contribute to, and submit pull requests with any changes. Sana is an open source platform and community contributions are highly encouraged and appreciated.

You may also contact us directly  at <a href="mailto:questions@sanamobile.org">questions@sanamobile.org</a> if you are interested in participating.
