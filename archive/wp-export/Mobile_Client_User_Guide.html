<h3>Overview</h3>
The Sana mobile client provides a programmable workflow that provides decision support, directs remote workers in the collection of data, connection between workers and physicians, and integrates with point of care applications and devices. The mobile client is designed so that it will run on most available Android devices including older and low-end devices that may be more readily available in resource constrained settings.

Decision support and data collection instructions are provided by defining scripts, or Procedures, that are interpreted at run time on the client. Procedures are stored in a simple XML based format that includes branching logic, defines the visual interface that will be presented to the user, and allows third party applications to be integrated into the Procedure. Please see the page on <a title="Defining Custom Procedures" href="http://sana.kidk.net/mobile/documentation/users/mobile/procedures/">Defining Custom Procedures</a> for instructions and complete details of all features.

<h3>General Usage Instructions</h3>
<div id="authentication">
<h4>Authentication</h4>
The authentication screen will be presented each time the user starts the application. The username and password must be verified before the user will be allowed to continue. <b>Important. </b>The application must validate the user credentials with the server the first time they attempt to access the app. This requires network connectivity. Upon successful validation, the user credentials will be cached on the device such that subsequent logins can occur with or without connectivity.

<h4>Manage Patients</h4>
Managing patients on the mobile client consists of registering new patients and selecting them to run procedures. After registering or selecting a patient, that patient will be considered the current active patient for any procedures to run. This was implemented to allow for running multiple procedures on a single patient without having to select or enter with each procedure. Users will be prompted with a dialog to verify that they wish to run a procedure for subsequent procedures when more than one is run.

<h5>Registering a New Patients</h5>
Registering a patient will walk the user through a series of prompts where the patients demographic information will be entered.

<h4>Run Procedure</h4>
Pressing the <strong>Run Procedure</strong> screen will present the user with a list of available procedures to run. The procedures stored on the device and interpreted at run time to present a series of prompts to the end users. Completion of the procedure will create a new <strong>Encounter</strong> object and associated Observations which are stored on the device and uploaded when the network is available.

For more information on creating your own procedures, please see the <a title="Procedures" href="http://sana.kidk.net/mobile/documentation/users/mobile/procedures/">Defining Custom Procedures</a> page.

<strong>Important note:</strong> Running a procedure requires a patient to have been selected prior to the start of execution. If a patient has not been selected, the user will be taken to the <a title="Mobile Client User Guide" href="http://sana.kidk.net/mobile/documentation/users/mobile/#patients">Manage Patients</a> screen.
