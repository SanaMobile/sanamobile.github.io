<h1><span id="Background" class="mw-headline">Background</span></h1>
One of the purposes of the mobile client is to act as a pluggable Point of Care(POC) device capable of data collection from nearly any hardware device integrated, or connected to, the mobile device . As such, one of the goals of future versions of the the Android based mobile client is to provide a library as well as base applications which 3rd party developers may use to develop applications which can interact with a wide range of the sensors and connectivity options considered recommended for Android based devices. Examples include, but are not limited to, USB, bluetooth, accelerometer, gyroscope, sound port, etc. The library and base applications would interact through the Sana plugin architecture which allows external applications to be launched, along with some control of the application, during the execution of decision support algorithms which provide the prompts utilized by community health workers. Furthermore, the types of devices which may be connected range from proprietary to any number of commodity devices.
<h1><span id="Data_Type_Compatibility" class="mw-headline">Data Type Compatibility</span></h1>
Data types collected by the device fall into one of two categories, (1) character sequences and (2) files. The mimetype of the data is therefore specified as either text/plain or that of the file as appropriate.
<h1>Plugin Library</h1>
The easiest way to create a plugin application is to develop an application that includes the <a href="https://github.com/SanaMobile/sana.plugin-library-android">Sana Android Plugin Library</a> as a dependency in Android Studio and include the appropriate information in a <strong>Procedure</strong> document as outlined in the <strong>Procedure Interface Syntax </strong>outlined below. Please see the Sana Android Plugin Library <a href="https://github.com/SanaMobile/sana.plugin-library-android/wiki">wiki</a> for additional information on using the library.

Further details on how to manually create an application that will work as a plugin are detailed on this page.
<h1><span id="Procedure_Interface_Syntax" class="mw-headline">Procedure Interface Syntax</span></h1>
Access to 3rd party applications is provided through either the PLUGIN or PLUGIN_TEXT elements. These elements include support for <i>action </i>and <i>mimeType</i> attributes which are utilized for determining which application to launch, type of data collected, and control parameters which will be passed to the 3rd party app. The basic syntax is as follows:
<pre>   &lt;Element type="PLUGIN" id="<i>id_value</i>"
       concept="<i>concept_name</i>"
       question="<i>question_value</i>"
       action="<i>action_value[;params]</i>"
       mimeType="<i>mimeType_value</i>"/&gt;
</pre>
or
<pre>   &lt;Element type="ENTRY_PLUGIN" id="<i>id_value</i>"
       concept="<i>concept_name</i>"
       question="<i>question_value</i>"
       action="<i>action_value[;params]</i>"
       mimeType="text/plain"/&gt;
</pre>
The <i>params</i> in the action attribute are optional. More information on the action attribute and control parameters is provided below.
<h2><span id="Action_Attribute_Conventions" class="mw-headline">Action Attribute Conventions</span></h2>
The naming convention for the <i>action_value</i> above is to use the external application package name appended with the <i>concept_name</i>. The <i>action_value</i>, along with <i>mimeType_value</i>, should be included in an IntentFilter for an Activity within the external application manifest.
<pre>   &lt;activity android:name="<i>.SomeActivity</i>"&gt;
       &lt;intent-filter&gt;
           &lt;action android:name="<i>action_value</i>"/&gt;
           &lt;data android:mimeType="<i>mimeType_value</i>"/&gt;
           &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/&gt;
       &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
   &lt;/activity&gt;
</pre>
The <i>action_value</i> format would then be:
<pre>   <i>application.package.concept_name</i>
</pre>
The <i>concept_name</i> in the procedure XML should be capitalized and any spaces replaced with underscores.
<h2><span id="Control_Parameters" class="mw-headline">Control Parameters</span></h2>
Additional control parameters may be included in the procedure markup by appending a set of one or more, semi-colon separated, key/value pairs to the action attribute as follows:
<pre>   &lt;Element type="PLUGIN" id="<i>id_value</i>"
       concept="<i>concept_name</i>"
       question="<i>question_value</i>"
       action="<i>action_value;key1=value1;key2=value2;...</i>"
       mimeType="<i>mimeType_value</i>"/&gt;
</pre>
The control parameters represented by the key/value pairs will be included in the Intent the Sana app passes to startActivityForResult() as String extras. It is the responsibility of the external application to parse the String extras into any numeric or other data formats.
<h2><span id="Capturing_and_Returning_Data" class="mw-headline">Capturing and Returning Data</span></h2>
How data is returned is similar for both PLUGIN and ENTRY_PLUGIN elements. There are a few differences described as follows.

For PLUGIN elements, the captured data <b>MUST</b> be written to the Sana ContentProvider using an OutputStream accessed using the data Uri included in the launch Intent:
<pre>   OutputStream os = null;
   try{
       os = getContentResolver().openOutputStream(getIntent().getData());
       ... do something here
   } finally {
       if (os != null) os.close();
   }
</pre>
The responsibility for closing the stream, as well as any buffering or other access techniques, is the responsibility of the plugin app. When the Activity is finished, a successful result <b>MUST</b> return a data Intent with the data Uri and mimetype equal to those of the launch Intent.
<pre>   Uri uri = getIntent().getData(); 
   String type = getIntent().getType();
   Intent data = new Intent();
   data.setDataAndType(uri, type);
   setResult(RESULT_OK,data);
   finish();
</pre>
For an ENTRY_PLUGIN element, the resulting character sequence is attached to the result data Intent as a fragment. When the Activity is finished, a successful result <b>MUST</b> return a data Intent with the data Uri and mimetype equal to those of the launch Intent.
<pre>   Uri uri = getIntent().getData();
   uri = uri.buildUpon().fragment(<b>result</b>).build();
   String type = getIntent().getType();
   Intent data = new Intent();
   data.setDataAndType(uri, type);
   setResult(RESULT_OK,data);
   finish();
</pre>
The instructions above assume the <b>result</b> is the value that needs to be returned.
<h2><span id="Data_Visualization" class="mw-headline">Data Visualization</span></h2>
External applications must also provide the means to view, in a meaningful fashion, any data collected. For simple character sequence data, which requires no processing, utilization of the PLUGIN_TEXT elements of a procedure will display the text to the end-user. For character sequences which require processing for meaningful visualization and all other data types, the 3rd party application <b>MUST</b> provide the tools for visualization of such data on the mobile client.
<h2><span id="Accessing_a_View_Activity" class="mw-headline">Accessing a View Activity</span></h2>
The Sana application assumes that the plugin app contains an Activity which declares an IntentFilter with an action value equal to the action attribute used in the procedure XML appended with <b>_VIEW</b>.
<pre>   &lt;activity android:name="<i>.SomeViewActivity</i>"&gt;
       &lt;intent-filter&gt;
           &lt;action android:name="<i>action_value</i>_VIEW"/&gt;
           &lt;data android:mimeType="<i>mimeType_value</i>"/&gt;
           &lt;category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/&gt;
       &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
   &lt;/activity&gt;
</pre>
The view Activity can then access the data using an InputStream using the data Uri included in the launch Intent:
<pre>   InputStream is = null;
   try{
       is = getContentResolver().openInputStream(getIntent().getData());
       ... do something here
   } finally {
       if (is != null) is.close();
   }
</pre>
The responsibility for closing the stream, as well as any buffering or other access techniques, is the responsibility of the plugin app.
